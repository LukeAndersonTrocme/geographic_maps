# Quebec Geographic Maps

This repository provides an **R script and dataset** for creating a **geographic map of Quebec**, focusing on **topography and hydrology**. The main script processes and visualizes elevation data alongside water features (rivers, lakes, and watersheds). The output is a **high-resolution background map** suitable for presentations, publications, and further geographic analysis.

These scripts are **highly customizable**, allowing users to modify layers, add new data sources, and experiment with **different geographic features**. This project serves as a **great starting point for programmatic map-making**, demonstrating how to:
- Load and **combine multiple geospatial datasets** from different sources.
- Customize **labels, points, and geometric annotations** (e.g., circles, north arrows, scale bars).
- Generate **publication-quality maps** with **ggplot2** and **sf**.

Whether you're a researcher, student, or GIS enthusiast, this repository provides a **practical introduction to geographic visualization in R** and can be adapted for various use cases.

## Features

- Uses **pre-processed geospatial data** (elevation, water features) to generate a background map.
- Includes **elevation shading** using rasterized digital elevation model (DEM) data.
- Displays **watercourses and watersheds** from open Canadian datasets.
- Adds a **reference circle** around a focal point (Mont Ã‰boulements), demonstrating geographic visualization techniques.
- Outputs both a **ggplot2 RDS object** and a **JPEG image** for easy reuse.

## **Usage**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukeAndersonTrocme/geographic_maps.git
cd geographic_maps/scripts
```
### **2. Install Required R Packages**
```
Rscript install_dependencies.r
```
### 3. **Run the Script**
```
Rscript advanced_map_demo.R
```
The generated map will be saved in the output/ folder as:
- advanced_map_demo.jpg (High-resolution image)
- advanced_map_demo.rds (ggplot2 object for further customization)

## **Contents**

### **Scripts**

- **`scripts/advanced_map_demo.R`**
    - Main script for processing elevation and hydrology data.
    - Crops datasets, applies filters, and generates the final geographic visualization.
    - Saves output as a `.jpg` and `.rds` file.

### **Data (Pre-processed)**

- **`data/alt_raster.RDS`** â€“ Elevation data from a **Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM)** raster.
- **`data/complete_watercourse_simplified_by_wts.RDS`** â€“ Simplified watercourses (rivers, lakes) aggregated by watersheds.

### **Output**

- **`output/advanced_map_demo.jpg`** â€“ Final map visualization (JPEG).
- **`output/advanced_map_demo.rds`** â€“ ggplot2 object for further modification.

## **Data Sources**

The geospatial data used in this repository is sourced from **Open Canadaâ€™s public datasets**:

### **1. Water Features (Rivers, Lakes, Watersheds)**

**National Hydro Network (NHN) â€“ GeoBase Series**  
[â†’ Open Canada: National Hydro Network](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a4b190fe-e090-4e6d-881e-b87956c07977)

- Provides geospatial data for **rivers, lakes, and drainage basins** across Canada.

### **2. Elevation Data**

**Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM)**  
[â†’ Open Canada: Digital Elevation Model](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7f245e4d-76c2-4caa-951a-45d1d2051333)

- Contains **gridded elevation data** used for terrain visualization.

## **Future Updates**

I plan to update this repository with more details on how the **pre-processed RDS files** (elevation, water features) were generated. This will include:
- The raw geospatial data sources used.
- The processing steps taken in **R** (e.g., cropping, simplifying, and filtering datasets).
- Scripts to allow users to recreate the datasets from scratch.

Stay tuned for future updates! ðŸš€
